# AI/ML Journey
### Purpose

Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to look at my AI/ML journey. This repository contains all of the work I've done to get where I am today with data science (with an emphasis on deep learning and neural networks). Each addition to this repository denotes a new and challenging concept I tried to cover in an attempt to learn something new. My hope is to develop this into a robust portfolio of projects spanning across different languages, libraries, frameworks, and architectures. I hope you enjoy!

### Structure
The repository is categorized into problem types (e.g. regression, classification, etc.). A large portion of the code base will be jupyter notebooks as I've found that to be the best way to learn data science and machine learning.

### Contact
If you--for whatever reason--would like to get ahold of me regarding this code, please feel free to reach out:
